# web-scraping-challenge
In this challenge we tried to scrape several website for different elements of them, the we converted it to a python file to finally try tu use all the collected data to produce an html file to view it through connections between the app.py file that contains the flask and mongo capabilities to connect the scrape_mars file to the html.
At this moment this challenge is not finished, the capabailities of the app.py file are not optimal and is the result is not viewable in the html file, I will continue to pursue the kowledge to finish this assignament in the future.
